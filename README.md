# Superstore-Sales-Analysis

For this project, I analyzed the Superstore dataset found on Kaggle (website is linked below). Using SQL, I conducted multiple queries to find the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for the dataset such as Total Revenue, Total Orders, Total Products sold, Average orders and Average quantity per orders. Additionally, I connected the SQL Server to PowerBI to create a dashboard that demonstrates all the KPI's and trends among total orders and total revenue. By transforming data and utilizing DAX functions, new columns with different measures were created to ensure the readibility of data in the charts. 

Below is a picture of the dashboard in PowerBI:
